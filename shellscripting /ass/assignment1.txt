Shell Scripting assignment

	1. Accept a filename as command line argument. Display all lines of that file which 
	contain the exact word "on" (on should match, whereas one, cron, and stone should not match)
	2. Write a shell script that accepts a filename as its argument and displays whether:
	(a) file exists or not
	(b) file is readable or not
	(c) file is writeable or not
	(d) is a plain file
	(e) is a directory

3. Write script that takes any number of ﬁles / folders as command-line
argument and creates tar ﬁle containing all those folders and ﬁles. The
name of tar ﬁle should be based on current date and time. Use following
format for naming tar ﬁle - YYYY-mm-dd-HH-mm-ss.tar. For example
2011-09-27-18-43-45.tar

4. A ﬁle contains list of roll numbers of students who copied assignment
from each other. Write program which reads the ﬁle and groups of all
students together who copied assignments. For example, if ﬁle has:
300106040 300294658
300106040 300107059
300109527 300109529
300109527 300642821
300106040 300754628
300892421 300992421
then output would be:
* 300892421 300992421
* 300106040 300107059 300294658 400605824 300754628
* 300109527 300109529 300642821

5. Find all hard-links of givenn ﬁel without using ‘find’ or any similar
command which can directly ﬁnd hard-linked ﬁles. Your script should
search entire partition for ﬁles which are hard-linked to given ﬁle.

Regex Assignment

	1.  Regular expressions	
	    Let the alphabet = {a,b}.  Note  e  is the empty string.  
	    Write regular expressions for:

      All words in which 'a' appears tripled (and only tripled, meaning all
      a's must appear in groups of three)(the empty string is valid).

      All words that contain at least one of the given strings s1, s2, s3, s4:
      (where s1, s2, s3, s4 are strings made up only of a's and/or b's).  For 
      example, s1 could be "ab" or "abbaa" or "aaa" or "b" .

      All words that contain exactly three b's in total.

      All words that contain exactly two b's or exactly three b's.

      All strings that end in a double letter.

      All strings that have exactly one double letter in them.

      All strings that do not have the substring "ab" .

	2.  Write a regular expression for all unsigned numbers in Pascal.  They are
	    strings such as 5280, 39.37, 499E3, 63.36E4, 1.894E-3, 2.3478E+11. 
	    You are not allowed to have a naked decimal point.  For example the number
	    5.  or  .5 is not allowed, must use 5.0 and 0.5.  The E is for exponent,	
	    essentially scientific notation.  

For these problems, the alphabet is {a,b}.
	3.  Write reg expr for words with 'b' as the second letter.

	4.  Write reg expr for words baa, ab, and abb .

5.  Write reg expr for only those words that have an even 
    number of letters total.

	6.  Write reg expr for only those words that do not end in "ba" .

	7.  Let the alphabet be {0,1}.  Write a regular expression for
	    the set of all strings not containing 101 as a substring.
